# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journey! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn, practice, and enhance my skills in cybersecurity. I will document my learning week by week, share notes, projects, and other relevant resources I encounter along the way. Feel free to follow along, suggest improvements, or share useful resources!

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

My ultimate goal is to gain practical knowledge in cybersecurity and become proficient in the following areas:
- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**: Understanding key concepts, including network security, cryptography, and security protocols.
- **Web Application Security**: Identifying vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and improving security for web applications.
- **Network Security**: Learning how to secure networks, identify threats, and prevent attacks.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conducting ethical hacking and vulnerability testing using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark.
- **Python Scripting for Cybersecurity**: Writing scripts to automate security tasks, penetration testing, and network analysis.
- **Security Certifications**: Working towards industry-standard certifications such as:
  - CompTIA Security+
  - Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
  - Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)

## ðŸ“… Weekly Progress

I will document my weekly progress here, outlining the topics I've covered, exercises completed, and any tools or resources I've used.

### [Week 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity](logs/week1.md)
- [ ] Completed an overview of cybersecurity basics.
- [ ] Set up a home lab using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.
- [ ] Learned about the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

### Week 2: Network Security
- [ ] Installed and configured **Wireshark** for network traffic analysis.
- [ ] Learned how to use **Nmap** for scanning networks and discovering open ports.
- [ ] Explored basic **firewall configuration** and its role in network security.

### Week 3: Web Application Security
- [ ] Explored common vulnerabilities: **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **CSRF**.
- [ ] Set up a simple web application to practice security tests.
- [ ] Experimented with **Burp Suite** for web vulnerability scanning.

(Progress will be updated as I continue.)

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Throughout this journey, I will be using various tools, platforms, and technologies:
- **Kali Linux**: A Linux distribution specifically designed for penetration testing and security auditing.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.
- **Nmap**: A network scanner to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- **Metasploit**: A penetration testing framework to identify vulnerabilities and exploit security gaps.
- **Burp Suite**: A web vulnerability scanner and testing tool.
- **Python**: For writing scripts to automate security testing and analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Progress Log

Iâ€™ll be keeping a detailed log of what Iâ€™ve achieved each week:

### Week 1: Cybersecurity Fundamentals
- Set up VirtualBox and installed Kali Linux.
- Explored basic networking principles, the OSI model, and types of network attacks.
- Configured firewalls using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) and iptables.

### Week 2: Network Security
- Analyzed network traffic using Wireshark.
- Conducted port scanning with Nmap and identified vulnerable services.
- Investigated a man-in-the-middle attack and its prevention techniques.

(Weekly updates will continue here as I progress.)

## ðŸ’¡ Future Projects & Goals
As I continue my learning, here are some projects and goals I plan to complete:
- **Create a Network Monitoring Tool** using Python to track incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Build a Web Vulnerability Scanner** for personal use in security testing.
- **Complete the TryHackMe Penetration Testing Path**.
- **Attempt a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition** to practice real-world hacking scenarios.
